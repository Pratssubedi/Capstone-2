## Objective
* The main objective of this project is to build a working predictive model. For that we analyze a large      corpus data set provided by swiftkey.
* Demonstrate the model through Shiny App

---

## Process
* Random Sampling of the corpus

* datacleaning by removing numbers unnecessary words,stemming, removal of html tags, emails, punctuations     white space etc.

* N-gram tokens were created for the data sample

* The N-gram tables are used to perform predictive analysis for the user inputs
